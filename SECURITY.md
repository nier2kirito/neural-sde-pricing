## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them privately by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [maintainer email] (if available)
2. **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact the maintainers directly

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios  
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Environment**: Affected versions and configurations
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands that demonstrate the issue (if safe to share)

### 🕐 Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **Initial Response**: 48 hours
- **Status Update**: 7 days  
- **Resolution**: 30 days (depending on complexity)

### 🛡️ Security Considerations

This project involves:

- **Neural Network Training**: Potential for adversarial inputs
- **Financial Calculations**: Accuracy is critical for financial applications
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Large computational requirements
- **Data Handling**: Processing of financial market data

### 🔍 Common Security Areas

Be particularly careful with:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure all inputs are properly validated
2. **Numerical Stability**: Prevent overflow/underflow in calculations
3. **Model Serialization**: Be cautious when loading saved models
4. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Keep dependencies updated
5. **GPU Memory**: Prevent memory exhaustion attacks

### 🏆 Recognition

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will:

- Credit reporters in security advisories (with permission)
- Acknowledge contributions in release notes
- Work with reporters to understand and fix issues
